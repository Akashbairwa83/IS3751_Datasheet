# IS3751: DMX to Addressable LED Converter IC
Control up to 170 3-color or 128 4-color Addressable LEDs

## General Description
The **IS3751** is a **DMX512-to-addressable-LED protocol converter chip**. It operates **fully autonomously**, requiring no microcontroller or processor, thereby reducing engineering costs and accelerating the product's **time-to-market**.

It can control up to **170 3-color** or **128 4-color** addressable LEDs at a refresh rate of **40 Hz**.

An **RS485 receiver or transceiver** converts the DMX differential signaling to TTL-compatible levels for the IS3751, which then directly generates data stream for the addressable LEDs.

The chip includes a pin for selecting between 3-color and 4-color addressable LEDs, and a **blinking indicator pin** to show when a DMX signal is present.

The device operates at **3.3 V**, with **5 V-tolerant open-collector LEDs control pin** and with **5 V-tolerant RX pin** for DMX input, allowing compatibility with both 3.3 V and 5 V RS485 receivers or transceivers.

It is available in **Industrial** (–40 °C to +85 °C) and **Extended** (–40 °C to +125 °C) temperature ranges. Smaller package options are available, contact sales for details.
